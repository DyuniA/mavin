                <br>
                I am an extrovert with an ENFJ personality, also called Protagonist Personality which is why I like being the leader in our groupings.</p>

                <p>  I have the phobias Agoraphobia, Nyctophobia and Scopophobia(I donâ€™t like the feeling that I'm being watched when Iâ€™m alone).

                <br>
                I also have a YouTube channel called â€˜Raspberry Fruitsâ€™ where I make Gacha videos using an app called Gacha club and Gacha life. In my free time, <br>I enjoy open-world, RPG games, reading manhwas, watching anime, drawing and even cosplaying!</p>

                <p> When I have nothing to do, I take my time reading manhwas online. I usually read manhwas about reincarnation, being in a game or novel, revenge, sibling complex, villainess being the good one and manhwa with good or eye-catching art style.  
                <br>    
                <br>
               Some of the manhwaâ€™s Iâ€™ve read are Villainess turns the hour glass, death is not the only ending for villainess, Into the light once again, and more!</p>

                <p>  Other than reading manhwas, I also love watching anime. I love to watch animes that is about reincarnation, the main character being overpowered, sibling complex, rom-coms which is why  my all-time favorite is Seven Deadly Sins, Sds has reincarnation, great art style, rom-com and the mc, Meliodas is the strongest.
