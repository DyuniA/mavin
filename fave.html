                <h1>ðŸ‘»FavoritesðŸ‘»</h1>
                <p>Genshin impact is included in my favorite game list  for a lot of reasons.   
                <br>    
                
               I started this game because of the twins, Lumine and Aether.  The gameâ€™s plot revolves around Aether on his search to find his missing sister whom he lost to Asmoday, the sustainer of heavenly principles.. I loved this gameâ€™s plot line and scenery, the character details and their animations are very praiseworthy.</p>

                Honkai Star Rail is also one of my favorite RPG games. Unlike Genshin Impact its design is more on the modern-technology side, for this game takes place in space. Caelus or Stelle is the main character who lost his/her memories after waking up at the Astral Express . Its plot revolves around the adventures of the main characters across different planets to find out who he/she really is. I started this game for its burst/ultimate skill animations but I ended up enjoying its lore</p>

                <p>Wuthering waves is a new game that was said to rival Genshin Impactâ€™s popularity. This game is about Rover(your character) who woke up in Solaris-3, a planet which had a big problem called the Lament, which turned Solaris-3 into a post-apocalyptic planet. At first, I only played to pull for characters and delete it right after, but, in the end, I loved its lore and animations.

                <p>Unlike my other favorite games, I didnâ€™t play Project Sekai for its story. Project Sekai is a rhythm game where you can play different Japanese songs, and since I love Japanese music I wanted to play it, at first it was hard but after sometime I gradually got better. I also loved how detailed the designs of the characters are that when I play story mode, It makes me feel like I'm watching anime as the characters also have voices that are Japanese.

                <p>As a Japanese song lover, I listen to a lot of artist. But there are two artists who stood out from the rest and became my favorite artist. They are Yoasobi and Kikuo, I love their songs so much that I listen to it almost everyday!
