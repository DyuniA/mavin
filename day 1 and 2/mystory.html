My parents signed me up for summer camp, <br> 
since they always see me watching anime on our television. <br>
I mean, I am not complaining about it since I enjoyed that lesson back in grade 6.<br>
So when I heard about it I was excited, too excited that I slept at 12:am.

Today, we were taught the basics of website making.<br>
 We used html, also called HyperText Markup Language.<br>
Other than that we also learnt some of the elements used in making a website.<br>
We also learned about how to add photos and even change its size.<br>
Soon, we will be learning how to add videos, and adding games to our website! <br>
